# to-do-list
A to-do list. Saves between runs of the program through writing list items to a JSON file. Coded using Python 3. Uses the Tkinter module for its interface. The first full Python project I made for myself, that is, not following a tutorial. You MUST have toDoListSaveFile.json in the same folder as toDoList.py (unless you're running the executable in which case a file will have been created inside your Documents folder under joseDzirehChongToDoList).
