# to-do-list

[LATEST EXE HERE](https://github.com/JoseDzirehChong/to-do-list/releases/tag/v0.0.0)

A to-do list. Saves between runs of the program through writing list items to a JSON file. Coded using Python 3. Uses the Tkinter module for its interface. The first full Python project I made for myself, that is, not following a tutorial.
Please note that renaming the save file or the folders it is in will break the program.

to-do-list-to-compile:

Contains a script. This script is compiled into an executable, as seen in Releases. If you just want a to-do list and you're not interested in the programming, download the exe, the script is its code and will not be of use to you if you do not have programming software.
