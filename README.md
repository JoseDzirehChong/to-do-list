# to-do-list
A to-do list. Saves between runs of the program through writing list items to a JSON file. Coded using Python 3. Uses the Tkinter module for its interface. The first full Python project I made for myself, that is, not following a tutorial. You MUST have toDoListSaveFile.json in the same folder as toDoList.py (unless you're running the executable in which case a file will have been created inside your Documents folder under joseDzirehChongToDoList).

Please note that renaming the save file or the folders it is in will break the program.

Different folders:

to-do-list:
Contains a script and a json file. Download them both and put them in the same folder for the program to work.

to-do-list-to-compile:
Contains a script. This script is to be compiled into an executable, as seen in Releases. If you just want a to-do list and you're not interested in the programming, download the exe, the script is its code and will not be of use to you if you do not have programming software. The toDoList.py here is slightly different to the one in to-do-list. You may have noticed that there is no toDoListSaveFile.json included in this. The program automatically makes the .json file for you in your Documents folder, under joseDzirehChongToDoList, which I think is pretty nifty.
